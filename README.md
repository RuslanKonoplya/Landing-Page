# 🧩 Project Stack

* Structure: The website is built using HTML5 with clean, semantic markup that follows BEM methodology. This ensures a clear structure, better accessibility for all users, and readiness for SEO optimization. Each section and component is    thoughtfully organized to maintain clarity and ease of maintenance.

* Styling: SCSS is used to create modular and maintainable styles. With the help of variables, mixins, and nesting, the CSS is structured efficiently, allowing for reusable components and a consistent visual style throughout the website. The BEM naming convention further enhances readability and organization of the styles.

* Responsiveness: The design is fully responsive, using CSS3 media queries to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. From mobile phones to tablets and desktop screens, every element adjusts gracefully, providing an optimal user experience and preserving the visual integrity of the layout.
